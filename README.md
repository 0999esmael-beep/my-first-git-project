# Portfolio - Quick Start

This is a minimal static portfolio scaffold using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small interactions (nav toggle, smooth scroll, form handling)
- `images/` — put your project screenshots here

Preview locally:

PowerShell (if you have Python installed):

```powershell
cd d:/web/portfolio
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or just open `index.html` directly in your browser (works for static preview).

Next steps:
- Replace placeholder text and images in `images/`.
- Replace project links in the Projects section with your repo/demo URLs.
- Optionally add a contact backend (Netlify Forms, Formspree, or your own API).
